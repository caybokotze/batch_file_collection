# batch_file_collection
A collection of windows batch files to enjoy.

## Warning:

_I wouldn't recommend just downlaoding and running all of these files since I haven't even done so in several years. Read through the script before executing them. There I said it, don't come crying to me if you crash your PC. None of these are extremely malicious, but some of them can slow down your PC until you reboot it._
